When it comes to lead generation websites, **featuring your phone number strategically** can significantly impact your conversion rates and overall user experience. Prospective clients often look for easy ways to get in touch, and prominently displaying your phone number builds trust and encourages direct contact.

## Optimal Locations for Your Phone Number

To maximize visibility and lead capture, consider the following prime locations to feature your phone number on a lead generation website:

### 1. Header (Top Right Corner)
The header is the first place visitors expect to find contact information. Placing the phone number in the **top right corner** ensures it stays visible throughout their browsing experience, especially if the site has a sticky header that remains visible during scrolling.

### 2. Homepage Hero Section
Including a **call-to-action (CTA)** alongside the phone number in the hero section—such as “Call Now for a Free Consultation: (123) 456-7890”—makes it easy for visitors to take immediate action as soon as they land on your site.

### 3. Footer Area
The footer is an essential navigation point where users often look for contact details. Keep the phone number in the footer so that it’s accessible from every page without taking up too much visual space upfront.

### 4. Contact Page
A dedicated contact page should prominently feature your phone number along with a contact form, email address, and physical location. This serves users who want detailed contact options.

### 5. Sidebar or Floating Call Button
For enhanced accessibility, consider a **floating or fixed call button** on the side of the screen, especially on mobile devices. This makes it effortless for users to call without having to search for the number.

## Best Practices for Displaying Your Phone Number

- **Make it clickable on all devices:** Use click-to-call functionality for mobile users.
- **Use contrasting colors:** Ensure it stands out against the background for immediate recognition.
- **Accompany with a CTA:** Words like “Call Now” or “Speak to an Expert” motivate users to act.
- **Consistent formatting:** Keep the same phone number format site-wide to avoid confusion.

The placement should enhance user experience and streamline lead capture without overwhelming the layout.
