**Lead generation** is a fundamental business process focused on attracting and converting strangers and prospects into someone who has indicated interest in your company's product or service. It plays a crucial role in sales and marketing by building a pipeline of potential customers.

At its core, lead generation involves a variety of strategies and techniques aimed at capturing the contact information of potential clientsâ€”commonly referred to as *leads*. These leads can then be nurtured through targeted marketing efforts and sales follow-up to increase the chances of turning them into paying customers.

### Key Aspects of Lead Generation

- **Attracting Prospects:** Using channels like content marketing, social media, search engine optimization (SEO), paid advertising, and email campaigns to drive traffic.
