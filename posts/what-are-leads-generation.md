Lead generation is the process of attracting and converting strangers or prospects into someone who has indicated interest in your company's product or service. **Leads** are potential customers who have shared their contact information or engaged with your brand in a meaningful way, making them valuable for sales and marketing teams. Effective lead generation boosts business growth by creating a pipeline filled with qualified prospects ready for nurturing and conversion.

## Why Is Lead Generation Important?

In today’s highly competitive market, simply having a great product or service isn’t enough. **Lead generation** helps businesses:

- **Identify potential buyers** interested in their offerings.
- **Build relationships** with customers before they make a purchase.
- **Improve marketing efficiency** by targeting those most likely to convert.
