At its core, digital marketing involves all online strategies used to connect with potential customers, build brand awareness, and ultimately drive sales. Lead generation fits perfectly within this definition as it focuses specifically on attracting and converting prospects into leads through digital channels.

## Understanding Lead Generation in the Context of Digital Marketing

**Lead generation** refers to the process of identifying and capturing interest from potential customers—known as leads—with the objective of nurturing them towards a purchase. When this is done via digital tools and platforms, it becomes an integral component of digital marketing strategies. Some key digital marketing elements that incorporate lead generation include:

- **Pay-Per-Click Advertising (PPC):** Using ads on platforms like Google Ads or social media to drive traffic and capture leads.
- **Social Media Marketing:** Leveraging social platforms to engage audience segments and generate interest.

Each of these channels builds awareness and drives qualified traffic to landing pages, contact forms, or chatbots, which are **lead generation tools**.
