Lead has been recognized as a serious health hazard for over a century, but formal regulations controlling its use started to emerge primarily in the mid-20th century. Understanding when lead became regulated requires looking at key milestones in public health policy, environmental legislation, and industrial reforms.

## Early 20th Century Awareness

In the early 1900s, medical research began linking lead exposure to severe health problems, especially in children. However, regulatory action was limited and piecemeal at best during this period. Lead was widely used in paint, gasoline, plumbing, and various consumer products without restrictions.

## Mid-20th Century: The Beginning of Formal Regulations

The **1960s and 1970s** marked a turning point, especially in the United States:

- **1971**: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued voluntary bans on lead-based paint in residential buildings.
- **1973**: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established, prioritizing lead as a pollutant.
- **1978**: The U.S. formally banned lead-based paint in residential properties, a landmark law aimed at reducing childhood lead poisoning.

## Regulation of Lead in Gasoline and Other Products

One of the largest sources of lead exposure came from **tetraethyl lead**, an additive in gasoline. Its phasing out began in the **1970s**:

- **1973**: The EPA initiated regulations to reduce lead content in gasoline.
- **1986**: The EPA banned leaded gasoline for on-road vehicles in the U.S.
- By the **1990s**, most industrialized countries had banned or severely restricted lead in gasoline.

## International and Further Regulations

Globally, lead regulations expanded through international agreements and national laws:

- The **World Health Organization (WHO)** has since classified lead as a major environmental health risk.
- Many countries adopted laws restricting lead in paint, water systems, cosmetics, and children's toys.
- Regulations continue evolving, addressing lead in soil, industrial emissions, and consumer products.

## Why Lead Regulation Matters Today

Leadâ€™s toxic effects include neurological damage, developmental delays, and cardiovascular problems. Regulations have been critical in:

- Reducing blood lead levels in populations worldwide.
- Phasing out lead in household and industrial environments.
- Supporting safer alternatives in manufacturing and construction.

## Conclusion

Lead began to be regulated in the early 1970s, with major milestones including the banning of lead-based paint in 1978 and the phased removal of leaded gasoline through the 1980s. These measures have significantly reduced lead exposure risks, although ongoing vigilance is necessary to address lingering contamination and emerging concerns.
