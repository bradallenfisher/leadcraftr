Gen. Erwin Rommel, famously known as the "Desert Fox," was the commander of the German Afrika Korps during World War II. While Rommel is widely recognized for his tactical brilliance in the North African campaign, it’s important to understand **who led Rommel** or was his superior during this critical phase of the war.

## Chain of Command Over Rommel in Africa

Rommel was ultimately under the authority of the **Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW)**, the Armed Forces High Command, which centralized overall German military operations. However, more specific to the North African campaign:

- **Field Marshal Albert Kesselring**  
  Before Rommel was deployed to North Africa in 1941, **Field Marshal Albert Kesselring** was the Commander-in-Chief of the German forces in the Mediterranean theater. Kesselring held operational control and was technically Rommel’s superior during much of the campaign.

- **General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim**  
  Later in the campaign, particularly during the final months in 1943, command was passed to **General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim**, who took over the remaining Axis forces after Rommel was recalled to Europe. While von Arnim did not lead Rommel, he became Rommel's successor in Africa.

- **Adolf Hitler**  
  Strategically, Rommel took orders directly from **Adolf Hitler**, who increasingly involved himself in operational decisions. Hitler’s direct interference grew as the war progressed, impacting Rommel’s campaign decisions.

### Summary of the Command Relationship

| Role                     | Name                 | Relationship to Rommel          |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Mediterranean Theater C-in-C | Albert Kesselring    | Operational superior           |
| Top German Military Leader | Adolf Hitler          | Strategic commander            |
| Rommel’s successor        | Hans-Jürgen von Arnim | Took over after Rommel’s recall|

## Why Is This Important?

Understanding Rommel’s leadership context highlights:

- **Rommel’s autonomy and limitations:** Although Rommel was a skilled field commander, he was still part of a larger command structure subject to Hitler and Kesselring.
- **The strategic challenges in Africa:** The command chain affected supply lines, reinforcements, and operational freedom, impacting Rommel’s effectiveness.
